This repository was created for personal use.
It was created with the idea, that i could share generel code for setting up my vim-configuration across multiple machines.

Any code here is not necessarily created by me, as I migth've copied it from various other repositories.

This coming part is copied from junegunn/vim-plug, and applies here as well:
