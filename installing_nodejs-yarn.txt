During the process of installing nodejs, coc and yarn I've encountered a couple of problems.

The links above was followed as a guide to set up my vim-config.

I installed nodejs using 'sudo apt-get install nodejs'.
I then encountered problems with installing yarn.
I eventually got reffered a command through the terminal, that helped me install yarn (I don't remember this command).

After setting these up i used the following vim-commands to get a CoC-extension and clangd.
"  :CocInstall coc-clangd      "
"  :CocCommand clangd.install  "

This concluded these steps in my vim-config process.
